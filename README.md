The **abstract** of this presentation is:

> In this session, we will talk about **uv**, an extremely fast Python package and project manager designed as a single tool to replace pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, virtualenv, and more. We will also discuss **marimo**, an open-source reactive notebook for Python that is reproducible, git-friendly, executable as a script, and shareable as an app.
